# Requirements
You must install the following for this mod to work:
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)
- [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
